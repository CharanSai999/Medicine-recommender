🧠 **Drug Recommendation System**



📌 Overview



The Drug Recommendation System is an intelligent web-based application that suggests suitable drugs for patients based on symptoms,  and disease data.

It uses Machine Learning algorithms to analyze input and recommend the most relevant medicines with accuracy and personalization.



This project was developed as my Final Year Engineering Project in Computer Science (AI \& ML).



⚙️ **Features**



🔍 Predicts suitable drugs for given diseases or symptoms



📊 Trained on real-world medicine datasets



💾 Uses SQLite database for user data and session management



🧠 Built using Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit



🌐 Simple and interactive web UI
